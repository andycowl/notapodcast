8 July 2011

After a decent rest, the team reassemble to produce a bumper edition
timed at the duration of a football match (including injury time).

In an effort to give both listeners a slim chance of identifying the
British accents and regional dialects, the gang perpetually introduce
and thank each other profusely by name throughout.

Fresh from the triumphant completion of his first year's undergraduate
course at Aberystwyth, Luke reviews a couple of fast food outlets
available in that fine city.

In the new 'Takeways' section inspired by Tim Bray, Luke favours
'Finger Lickin' Chicken' for its close proximity to the Pier nightclub
although he docks 10 points for only selling Coca Cola Light. Finger
Lickin' just edges out Sam's Fried Chicken ('hard chicken, sometimes
live') but enjoys an excellent location adjacent to the legendary 24
hour Spar.

Like all embryonic podcasts, the urgent need for a TINAP Code of
Conduct (CoC) is finally recognised which inevitably leads to 43
minutes of smutty, Viz style innuendo and endless double entendres.

Helpful hints and tips for coping with the stresses and strains of
commuting are discussed in a vain effort to restore Richard (train
rambler) Cutts' sanity.

Errata

[r7](http://identi.ca/r7) corrected loads of embarrassing musical
related errors which we are pleased to correct.

The fine art of podcast plagiarism is discussed so David introduces a
brilliant new innovation - Room x11r5 - which is, in no way, inspired
by Room x1101 from The Dick Turpin Roadshow. Imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery.

Dr. Michael C. Harris and Andy are locked in a deadly embrace of not
having the requisite knowledge to appear on each other's fictional
podcasts.

StatusNet
[appoint](http://status.net/2011/06/07/statusnet-inc-hires-mark-ruddock-as-ceo)
a new CEO, Mark Ruddock, who won't actually eat his own
[dog food](http://identi.ca/markruddock) and use identi.ca. Luke is
dispatched to Canada with a tin of Pedigree Chum and a pair of rusty
pliers to rectify this situation.

David claims he's an intellectual (like Josh Wood) by joining a
social network aimed at ferocious, voracious readers called
'[Byliner](http://byliner.com)'.

A recent unplanned 6 hour outage on identi.ca forces us to confront
the elephant in the room and contemplate escape routes if identi.ca
ever, God forbid, became permanently unusable.

David expresses an interest in self-hosting his own StatusNet instance
but is completely bamboozled by reading 'INSTALL' so goes back to
smoking his pipe and reading books.

Andy produces documentary evidence that a Web based
[installer](http://andyc.tumblr.com/post/87045103) was included in
Laconica 0.7 that made installation as easy as the famous 5 minute
WordPress installation.

We anticipate the release of StatusNet 1.0 by pondering on how close
Evan is to his stated target of 1,000,000 StatusNet instances.

Luke has concerns about whether the StatusNet 1.0 API will be extended
to support development of fully functional StatusNet clients (e.g
conversations).

Despite wearing industrial ear defenders, we are deafened by the
prolonged and very loud Telecaster feedback kindly provided by Fabian
Scherschel.

Podcast Watch enjoys [kevie](http://identi.ca/kevie)'s new TuxJam
podcast with an interesting mix of music and Open Source software and
his soft Scottish accent which brings poet
[Ivor Cutler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivor_Cutler) to mind.

The incredibly busy [Fab](http://identi.ca/fabsh) partners with
[Bradley Kuhn](http://identi.ca/bkuhn) to start the
[Rant o'Fab & Kuhn](http://sixgun.org/rant) podcast and discuss
‘Godwin’s Law’ (You’re just like Hitler, you are’).

[Doug Whitfield](http://280.status.net/douglasawh) and
[Tim Ray](http://identi.ca/tmray) produce two podcasts -
[MusicManumit](http://www.musicmanumit.com/) together with a
[talk show](http://www.musicmanumit.com/search/label/talk) while
[Stephen](http://brainbird.net/marxistvegan) produces a show with a
more political slant - [CyberUnions](http://cyberunions.org/podcast-2/).

Andy splashes out on an Acer netbook, installs Chromium OS on it
(rendering the 250GB hard disk redundant) and enjoys the experience
until he lost his internet connection for 3 hours.

Andy and Luke are privileged enough to witness The Mighty Fall in
person in London and Manchester respectively and confirm they are
'Always different, always the same'.

'This Is Not A Podcast' is very proud and honoured to present the wonderful
'[I Am Not Left Handed](http://www.iamnotlefthanded.com/)' introducing
their latest single '[Alone](http://www.jamendo.com/en/album/91259)
(It's not so bad)' from the forthcoming album 'The Fire And The Sigh'.

The sports roundup
[mourns](http://nbrightside.com/blog/2011/05/28/rob-daley-rip) the
death of Rob Daley, the father of young British diver, Tom Daley and
provides the exciting and predictable conclusion to Andy's London
Olympics ticket saga.

We also look at Wimbledon, or at least the footage of Pippa Middleton
and a pretty blonde lady sucking on a strawberry in a suggestive
manner.

The history of Fab's Telecaster from the man himself:

> The guitar is called Leilani and started life as a Made in Mexico
> (MIM) Standard Telecaster with sunburst finish. I bought it in
> 2004. I have since changed the neck (the current neck is from a MIM
> Baja Tele) and stripped down the paint on the body. I've refurbished
> it late last year in vintage blonde myself. The electronics are all
> custom by now with a modded Leosounds neck pickup and a 52' RI
> bridge pickup and corresponding old-style bridge. I've also build in
> an S3-switch and change the whole cabling while shielding the inside
> as well. So in short, it's a true Frankencaster now, all modded to
> hell but exactly as I like it.
