The long awaited episode 5 finally emerges and welcomes Ed Morgan
([mo6020](http://identi.ca/mo6020)) to share a can of Red Stripe on
the virtual sofa. We hold Ed to his bold promise that 'TINAP is
awesome and could only be improved by me appearing on the show'. Ed is
forced to endure the standard 'This Is Not A Podcast' initiation
ceremony of waiting for a full 75 minutes while Andy fails to
configure his audio from a Cairo hotel room (again).

However, the show must go on and the 'ABORT ABORT ABORT' message
broadcast on identi.ca is subsequently aborted with just seconds to
spare. Which was nice.

Ed tries to make up for the fact he isn't a Geordie by telling us he
in possession of a stolen respirator unit from the British Army.

The gang attempt to spice up the show - mainly for
[r7](http://identi.ca/r7)'s benefit - with occasional hidden, oblique
references to The Fall.

In tribute to our newly married Prince and Princess, we blast out a
hearty rendition of the National Anthem (apart from the staunch
Republican David) although, inevitably, his resolve weakened and he
joined in.

The new, exciting 'Errata' section, detailing all our cock ups and
mishtakes with fulsome apologies to all and sundry, lasts most of the
show.

Ed gets his guitar out to introduce the legendary 'Feedback' section
as we review Richard [Fontana](http://identi.ca/fontana)'s assorted
and cryptic thoughts on the show.

Luke tries and fails to impersonate an ocean liner by blowing over a
can of Kronenburg 1664.

'Podcast Watch' reviews the inaugural epsiode of The Dick Turpin Road
Show [tdtrs](http://tdtrs.tumblr.com/) featuring
[Dick Turpin](http://identi.ca/dickturpin) and
[Matt](http://identi.ca/yamatt) chatting en-route in a car (with the radio on) to Rathole Radio in Liverpool.

We fuel rumours of another UK based podcast being fermented in
Scotland by [Gordon Sinclair](http://identi.ca/thistleweb) and
[Kevie](http://identi.ca/kevie) (with occasional random contributions
from [weeguy](http://identi.ca/weeguy)).

Andy reviews the Royal Wedding street party and bemoans his defeat in
the scooter racing to a four year old girl.

Luke spends 3 days scanning a BBC panoramic HD
[photo](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13200114) of Daily Mail readers
thronging the mall and manages to locate an idiot proudly waving a
stick minus his flag attachment.

Kjetil Hoiseth ([hz](http://identi.ca/hz)) kindly offers his Mumble
server and also spends 47 minutes playing the ever popular TINAP
game - 'Listen to Andy swearing a lot and failing to configure his
audio (again)'.

Andy celebrates his 30,000th dent and bores everyone rigid by reading
out assorted highlights from his first 10,000.

'Innovation Watch' is hugely impressed by James Robertson's
([jrobertson](http://identi.ca/jrobertson)) recent attempts to
remember 40 random numbers overnight and David senses a business
opportunity here as a [lastpass](http://lastpass.com) alternative.

We wonder whether Google's Chromebook will appeal to Auntie Betty and
Uncle Harry and whether a price of £349 is too much for Yorkshire
people.

The inevitable Gnome 3/Unity discussion ensues and Ed impresses
everyone with the fact that his Dad is a serial distro hopper.

Episode 5 - ‘Canny Bag O'Tudor’ (1h 10m 03s).

We attempt to appease Jon The Nice Guy
([jontheniceguy](http://jon.sprig.gs/)) by mentioning his Top of the

ScaryDuck notes a worrying but undeniable
[correlation](http://scaryduck.blogspot.com/2011/05/chilling-fact-that-connects-worlds-most.html)
between bearded people and prolific serial killers.

If you've never heard of The Fall before, people tend to love them or
hate them. This
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyLDuo2xUqI&list=PL1F410A444995E41B),
from a recent show in Paris, gives a flavour of lead singer's Mark. E
Smith's unique singing style, the current lineup and the superlative
wall of noise.
