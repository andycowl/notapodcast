Back on Thursday 23 July 2009, Andy stupidly remarked ‘It would be
great fun to do a podcast about identi.ca, footy, music and stuff’.

In March 2011. David suddenly awoke from his slumber and remembered.

Luke also wanted to do a podcast called ‘I am probably angry about
something’ and was really angry when we declined his choice of name.

The show is only available in Ogg format for the following reasons:

  - We love freedom.
  - We are quite lazy. Burning the Ogg takes over 30 minutes.
  - We all live for the day when some idiot moans on Twitter that their
    iPad wouldn’t play this stupid, fricking podcast and what the fuck
    is OGG anyway ?!
  - Ogg Vorbis is better sound quality than the patent encumbered MP3 format.
  - Most modern media players can be persuaded to play Ogg format audio files
