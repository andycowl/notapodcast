In this inaugural episode, David, Luke and Andy conquer technology and
eventually manage to talk to each other using a variety of VOIP
technologies. David then succeeds in recording the resulting antics.

This bizarre 'Menage A Trois' address the thorny issue of naming this
podcast and take a light hearted look at recent events on identi.ca,
stir up recent <strike>flame fests</strike> passionate discussions,
ponder on the attractions of Minecraft and then pay a fulsome tribute
to the best dent of all time as well as a fleeting look at football
and politics.

The spontaneous and unexpected interruptions for the fire alarm and
room service were not beautifully crafted comedy moments - just a
welcome accident of timing.

This broadcast was conducted via freedom hating (and new sponsors)
Skype complete in full Dolby stereo. The audio quality is pretty good
given Andy was located deep in Osama Bin Laden's cave with a kettle on
his head.

Kudos to David for a sterling job on the incredibly time consuming and
tedious task of converting Gigabytes of rambling, stuttering audio
from a short 3 minute show with 72 minutes of out-takes into what
became episode #1.

The main driver behind this experiment was purely the fun and
enjoyment we all get from the discussions and interesting people on
identi.ca. Many thanks to all the folk who post there and to Evan and
the StatusNet team for creating this open source micro blogging
platform which made it all possible.

We're new to this. We made a few (lots - Ed) mistakes. We're not
professional podcasters. We don't use studio microphones. We don't
record separate audio streams. We're unlikely to be able to give up
our day jobs.

However, if you have anything to say; constructive, abusive or
anything inbetween, please run, don't walk, to the '<a
