### Guest Informant

In order to initiate the TINAP globalisation strategy, Luke Slater is
flown first Aclass to California only to discover a note on
[Josh][joshix] Wood's door saying 'Gone Fishing'.

[joshix]: http://identi.ca/joshix

Undeterred, we call upon Richard [Cutts][rpcutts] who graces us with
his presence on the sofa, brandishing a bottle of Hooky Gold and meekly
covering his 'Inner Circle Of Trust'.

<a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/pGcahMGzxN06NdLAA6yUaJKI9WeOqPfUAXHyghKXlVM?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-nYHxMiXSqf8/TjcSkOMN85I/AAAAAAAABwc/-ZqQciJ1QVA/s288/HookyGold.jpg" height="288" width="216"></a>

Long standing identi.ca user, Richard, founded the 'First Against The
Wall' ([fatw][fatw]) group, coined the legendary 'Good Moaning' greeting
and regales the world with his daily commuting woes on 'Northern
Rail'. Richard also has a strange hybrid Yorkshire/Geordie accent -
mainly to confuse Richard [Fontana][fontana].

Richard sings the praises of Josh Wood and Luke claims he once
understood one of his American literature references without recourse
to Google.

### Roundup

James [Robertson][jrobertson] expands his media publishing empire with
the exciting launch of multiple branded 'JR' microsites:

- [Blog](http://jamesrobertson.eu/blog/2011/07/18/1814hrs.html)

Some identica folk produce some exciting experiments pushing the
envelope with the rich media capabilities of Google Plus.

[Richard][RichPhoto] and [Ed][EdPhoto] post artistic self portraits
and invite the Internet to answer '\#amihotornot' while Josh posts a
[recipe][JoshRecipe] for fricassee with plenty of paprika (without cat
piss).

If you can't see these links, then you're not in the appropriate
'Inner Circle Of Trust' but to hell with our guests' privacy, civil
liberties and FREEDOM.

A classic recursive [thread][ubs] on identi.ca involving the use of 'Acronyms

[Scott Evans][vk7hse] lets us down and dents our confidence in all
Australians by failing to provide his promised feedback. He is now
blacklisted, black balled and banned from the premises.

Oxbrow Luke reads a prepared statement from [Josh Wood][Josh]
explaining (sort of) his absence from the sofa which David struggles
to understand.

### Errata

There is no Errata section. Episode 6 was perfect in every regard.

### Podcast Watch

David gives a shout out to the [Open Tech Exchange Podcast][OTEP]
hosted by [Mark Clarke][mxc] and [Darlene Parker][darlene].

David gels his hair into a sharp quiff and listens to some
psychobilly, blues and ska coutrtesy of the [Goat Rodeo][GoatRodeo]
hosted by [Andy Barilla][bassburner].

We all have a bloody good laugh at the Linux Action Show's childish
spat with Linux Outlaws and an even better laugh at the hosts ('Beavis
and Butthead') with their oh so stylish 1970's haircuts.

### Tech

David looks at open source alternatives to Google Plus and we struggle
to pronounce <del>Diaper</del>, <del>Disprin</del>, Diaspora and
Friendika - Ulrika's Johnsson's entry into social networking.

David also assists [Michele][macno] creating a powerful spamming
utility that simultaneously cross posts to identi.ca, Google Plus,
Twitter and Facebook.

Matt Lee shows great spirit and answers random, probing questions from
Luke and David for a full hour.
