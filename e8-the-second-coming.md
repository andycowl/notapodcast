### Comeback Kid

'Where the hell have you lot been ?'

- Luke - left Aberyswyth and moved 820 miles to work for the
  prestigious technology company, Google, in sunny Zurich.
- David - moved 7 miles to grow his own potatoes, carrots and
  cauliflower and pineapples. Embarked on securing his football
  coaching badges culminating in England lifting the World Cup in
  2018.
- Andy - [overcame][] a minor health issue to emerge
  victorious. Diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder following
  the events of [Sunday 13 May 2012][citeh].

###  Tech

In the 15 month hiatus, TINAP has a new domain name, new web site, new
subscription options (separate subscription options for
Ogg/MP3/Stereo) and the reassuringly same old crap audio quality (this
time courtesy of Luke who is halfway up the Matterhorn).

### Episode 8 - ‘The Second Coming’ (59m 08s)

Ogg (mono): [ogg][] (30.4MB)
MP3 (mono): [mp3][] (29.7MB)
Ogg (stereo): [stereo][] (31.3MB)
