Digitally remastered and cynically released in time for Christmas,
this 10 minute TINAP trailer is handy for:

- check your favourite bits are included
- test yourself by identifying each speaker
- marvel at the sound quality improvements
- show your friends what they missed
- listen for 10 minutes not 10 hours

> Do not stand at my grave and cry
> TINAP is not there; TINAP will never die.
