The intrepid trio produce episode 4 using Mumble, an open source VOIP
technology. This strategic decision costs TINAP £750,000 in lost
sponsorship from Skype but that's the price you pay to fully embrace
freedom.

Luke is fairly subdued after getting his GSOC application rejection
letter and drinking large quantities of absinthe the night before.

In a effort to create recursive meta-meta recursion and avoid paying
any more royalties, David creates some genuine real-life feedback for
the 'Feedback' section using an electric guitar.

Prompted by Marie Axelsson, the chaps convene an Extraordinary
General Meeting live on-air to discuss whether the pros and cons of
the Flattr micro-payment system and why Andy's OCD means a Flattr
badge is unlikely to appear on the TINAP site.

Andy foolishly writes his own P45 by discussing Oracle's decision to
relinquish control of OpenOffice but thinks whispering will help.

Andy reviews Android clients for identi.ca, feels slightly queasy at
the amount of Twitter-speak he encounters and ultimately finds no
compelling application to dislodge the wonderful Mustard.

We confront the thorny issue of meta micro blogcasting, addiction and,
unlike many podcasts, provide Samaritans style guidance on how to cope
with suicidal feelings.

We are forced to confront an oversized grey animal sitting quietly in
the corner of the studio and Luke separates Josh and Gordon outside a
virtual public house, screaming 'Come on now. Come on. Just leave
it. He's not worth it, mate'.

'Podcast Watch' unearths a gem of a podcast from Down Under complete
with suboptimal audio, hilarious show notes and two men babbling on
and laughing at their own jokes. Kudos to Matthew Davidson and Ruben
who produce the wonderful Sawtell podcast. In fact, it's so good we
immediately launched a successful DDOS attack to bring their servers
down.

Luke enjoys the monthly Libre.fm podcast which showcases the most
popular freely available music while David hates all podcasts and
podcasters.

David and Andy both enjoyed the simultaneous video and audio streams
from the Rathole Radio Live gig from Liverpool but were unable to
attend the event in person due to their Mancunian accents.

In response to popular demand, the football section is extended to
cover the exciting climax to the domestic season, Champions League
semi-finals and the outpourings of idiotic footballers on Twitter.

In other news, Andy has secured a second mortgage and applied in the
ballot for London 2012 Olympics tickets primarily to see girls in
leotards and men sporting miniscule Speedo swimming trunks.

Episode 4 - ‘One take, no overdubs’ (1h 11m 0s).
