'This Is Not A Podcast' is very pleased to welcome the founder of
StatusNet and CEO of E14N - Evan Prodromou.

Evan clarifies the pronounciation of Pump I/O - much to David's
disgust who wanted a 'dot'.

David tries to endear himself to Evan by composing and devoting a song
'[Pump Dot IO][song]' to the great man which brings Evan to
tears. Literally.

Evan talks about the demands of giving sensible interviews to
technical and non-so-technical audiences and recommends:

- [LWN article][LWN] by Nathan Willis.
- [OpenSource.com article][OS] by Bryan Behrenshausen.

Evan discusses some of the lessons learned from StatusNet, the
rationale for creating yet another social networking platform and
development of different clients including the notorious OpenFarmGame,
the mere mention of which makes Andy hyperventilate.

Andy plays Devil's Advocate to ask deep, probing, uncomfortable
questions about the lack of a StatusNet to Pump bridge, limitations in
the Web client, broken notifications etc.

Evan sheds light on the future of StatusNet/GNU Social and discusses
the business model for Pump which is rather different from StatusNet.

Evan senses an increased level of developer interest and participation
in the Pump platform, with the development of libraries, clients and
services for a relatively young platform.

Evan is honest enough to give his post-mortem analysis on the now
legendary StatusNet to Pump migration which overran slightly and his
thoughts on the pros and cons of dealing with demanding users.

Andy gets bored of the technical talk and gives Evan a quick
French test.

The 'Quick Fire Question Round' attempts to reveal the man behind
Evan Prodromou. Some of his answers will amuse, entertain and
occasionally shock you.

Evan outlines his short term goals for version 0.3.0 which are to address
fundamental usability issues in the Pump software.

The team also help Evan by helping him practice for his Canadian Citizenship
examination.

### After the Lord Mayor's Show

The lads are left momentarily speechless as Evan rejoins his family
for croissants and freshly squeezed orange juice on vacation.

Andy and David mourn the passing of Google Reader, demand explanations
from Luke and welcome our newest listener - the NSA.

Neighbourhood Watch turns its attention to a flurry of criminal activity
in Leith (nr. Scotland) and we summarise a recent spate of celebrity deaths
and illnesses.

'Gardener's Question Time' features David's roundup of his attempts at
self-sufficiency in West London (without the aid of Felicity Kendal).

### Sport

Devoid of any football matches whatsoever, we celebrate another British
success in the Tour de France and talk about music instead.

### Podcast Watch

Podcast Watch has enjoyed [Duffercast][Duffercast] - a bunch of old duffers
discussing a wide ranging and frankly bizarre set of topics and
Douglas' latest addition to the Sportazine media empire - [TINT][TINT].

[Duffercast]: http://duffercast.org/2013/06/12/duffercast-0-a-stealth-lawnmower/
[TINT]: http://sportazine.com/football/this-is-not-tinap-tint-episode-1

Andy celebrates Nev Wilshire, the David Brent like boss of a Swansea call
centre who motivates new hires with a karaoke version of 'Mr. Brightside'.

The longest TINAP episode ever is rounded off by a spontanous outburst
of 'Rant-O-Cast' by Andy where he impersonates Richard Wilson and sounds
off about various people and activities that irritate him.
